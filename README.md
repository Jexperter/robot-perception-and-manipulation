# robot-perception-and-manipulation

In the pdf file attached "robot_perception", I created a table to compare the following: semantic segmentation, object detection, instance segmentation, 2D grasp detection, and 6DOF pose estimation.
I wrote a 1-page report about the undesrtanding of Mask R-CNN. I run a Mask-RCNN from my webcam,I calculated the center point of the segmented task, and I used PCA to extract two principal axes from each segmented task and visualised the results shown in the video.
